My personal webpage

The theme is based on [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo) and licensed under MIT. Its source code and contributors list can be found at <https://github.com/poole/hyde>


## Development

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

Just run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

The first time you need to install the dependencies by running `bundle install`. That will install the gem versions currently used in Github pages, so that you have the same version locally in development as in production. Once in a while, you may want to synchonize with Github pages by running `bundle update`.
